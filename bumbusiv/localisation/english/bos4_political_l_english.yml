 obligatory_abdication_monarchy_desc:0 "A monarchy of any kind, where the monarch abdicates after a period of time, having to pass it on to a younger member of their family. The honorary Kingdom of the Omniverse uses this ideology for their ruling style. While rarely practised elsewhere, it could cause turmoil if succession is not planned out properly. Some of these monarchies, especially the Kingdom of the Omniverse, requires the monarch to be married or betrothed."
